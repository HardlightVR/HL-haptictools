# HL-haptictools
Code used to quickly manipulate and parse complex haptic assets.

### Please note:
Hardlight VR was a complex project involving many dependencies. We have decided to open the code in the hopes that others may make use of the tools and plugins we built over the last 5 years. However, some software may not have been built or tested in some time, and may require changes to be used with the latest VR software and technology. 

### Contributing and Contact
We welcome any and all interest in derivative projects made from this software, edits to the software, and updates to the plugins and drivers! If you are interested in contributing to the public Hardlight repositories, please create an issue, or email hardlightvr@gmail.com.
